# Crime Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles using Python and Streamlit. It provides insights into crime trends, locations, and types through interactive visualizations and data exploration.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive Visualizations with Streamlit
- Crime Frequency Mapping
- Most Used Weapons Analysis
- Crime Trends Over Seasons
- Age Group Analysis of Victims
- Identifying Crime Hotspots

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard
- **Geopandas**: Geospatial analysis (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Haritha37A/Crime_Analysis.git
   cd Crime_Analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **"Crimes in Los Angeles 2020-2023"** from Kaggle. It contains information about various crimes, including date, location, type of crime, weapons used, and victim demographics.

## Usage
1. Explore crime trends over time and by season.
2. Analyze the most frequently used weapons in crimes.
3. Examine the age group distribution of victims.
4. Identify crime hotspots and high-crime locations.
5. Filter data by location, date, or crime type.
6. Visualize crime patterns using charts and maps.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Machine Learning for crime prediction.
